We have just spent the last few weeks implementing our 32-bit datapath.  The
simple 32-bit LC-2200 is capable of performing advanced computational tasks
and logical decision making.  Now it is time for us to move on to something
more advanced.
</p>
<p>
We have invested a great deal of time and money into developing a more powerful
LC-2200 computer.  This one supports interrupts.
</p>
<p>
The only trouble is that the interrupt support does not appear to be completed.
We are quite disappointed by this, and so it is your assignment to fully implement
and test interrupts using your datapath.

</p><p>
This project has you add the additional support needed to make all this work properly.
 Your job will be to hook up the interrupt acknowledge lines to the input devices,
 modify the datapath to support interrupt operations, and write an interrupt handler
 to increment the clock value at a designated memory address.

<a name="what"><h2>What We've Provided</h2></a>
<p> We have provided the LC2200-32 datapath, the completed XML (or FSM) file from the previous
project and a assembly file to run on the datapath.  Intergenerator.circ has also been provided,
which will generate an interrupt signal every so often.

<p>
Initial Interrupt hardware support
</p>
<p>
For this part of the assignment you need to add hardware support for interrupts.
 </p>
<p>As you may have noticed we have no way to keep track of whether or not
 interrupts are currently enabled or disabled.  Make an interrupts enabled
 register (the output of this register is referred to as <b>IE</b> signal in the rest of the project description.)
</p>
<p>
You should modify your memory circuit to detect unaligned accesses (Last two bits not 00 for word access) for this project dont worry about correcting the access:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It should signal the controller with an interrupt when it detects an unaligned access
</li><li>If it has fired an interrupt it should continue to signal the interrupt until it receives an IntAck signal.
 When it receives IntAck it should drive its device handler address to the bus in the following cycle (or if
 you prefer you may use the same cycle you assert IntAck.)
</li></ol>
<p>
You will need hardware to store the interrupt signal in case it is not immediately 
acknowledged, and hardware that will drive the device handler
onto the bus in the cycle after it has received IntACK(or if you prefer it can be the same cycle).

</p>

<p>For some interrupt related instructions we will need to directly access the
 reserved interrupt register (Reffered to as IntR from here on).  Create the hardware needed to select IntR 
within microcode.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="p1"><h4>Part 2: Controller Interrupt Support</h4></a>

<p>
In this part of the assignment you will modify the microcode
 of the LC2200-32.  </p>

<p>
You will need to implement three new instructions to handle interrupts 
<ol>
<li> EI - This should tell the processor to start allowing the currently running task to be interrupted
</li>
<li> DI - This will make sure after it has been executed that task can not be interrupted
</li>
<li> RTI - This should transfer control to the address stored in IntR, and enable interrupts
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b> Implementing the control for interrupt handling: </b>

</p>

<p>The figure below is provided for reference purposes.  </p>

<p><a href="pics/three_rom_controller.png" target="pics/three_rom_controller.png"><img src="pics/three_rom_controller.png" border="0"></a></p>

<p>As you may have noticed, we currently have an unused input on our 
multiplexer.
  This gives us room to add another ROM to control the next microstate 
upon an interrupt. You
  need to use this fourth ROM to generate the microstate address when an
 interrupt is signaled.  The input to
  this ROM will be controlled by your interrupt enabled register and the
 interrupt
  signal asserted by the memory error interrupt from the part 1.  This fourth 
ROM should have a 2-bit address and contain the next state. The least significant 
input bit should be an AND of the IE register output and the interrupt 
signal from the interrupt device.  The most significant input bit of the
 ROM should be set to 0.  The output will depend on how you write the 
microcode for the main ROM.
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>First we must modify the controller.  Add the new Interrupts ROM as described above.  <br>
We will also be needing 2 new signals for interrupt control that are generated by the main ROM (that controls the datapath):
</p><ol>
<li> LdEnInt (This asserts the load input of the IE register),
</li><li> IntAck (this sends an interrupt acknowledge to the device).
</li></ol>

You need to extend the size of the main ROM accordingly.

</li><li>
Second we must add a way to check for interrupts. You can accomplish
this by
 modifying FETCH macrostate in the following way (basically we are doing
 the work that needs to be done implicitly by the processor in the INT
macrostate described in Chapter 4 of the textbook and class lectures in
the FETCH macrostate itself):


<ol>
  <li> Check to see if an interrupt is raised (and the proccessor is accepting them right now)
  </li><li> If not, continue as normal.
  </li><li> If yes:
  <ol>
  <li> Save the current PC into IntR.
  </li><li> Disable interrupts.
  </li><li> Assert the interrupt acknowledge line, and then a cycle
  later (depending on how you chose to implement part 1 maybe the same cycle)
  use the value put out on the bus by the device that
  received the IntAct signal, as the new PC value.
  </li><li> Continue with the FETCH marcrostate.
  </li></ol>
</li></ol>

</p></li><li>
Third we need the three new instructions for supporting interrupts as
described in Chapter 4. These are the EI, DI, and RETI instructions.  You
 need to write the microcode in the main ROM controlling the datapath
for these three new instructions.
<ul>
<li> EI sets the IE register to 1.
</li><li> DI sets the IE register to 0.
</li><li> RTI loads IntR into PC, and enables interrupts.
</li></ul>

<p></p>

<a name="p2"><h4>Part 3: Interrupt Handler for the Memory
Interrupts</h4></a>
<p>
Now that we have interrupt support within the processor, we need to
write an interrupt handler for our memory interrupt so that it will
 not interfere with the correct running of any user program.
</p>
<p>In prj2.s we provide you with a program that runs in
the background.  For part 3 of this project, you have to write an
interrupt handler for the memory access device.  Refer to Chapter 4 of the
textbook to see how to write a correct interrupt handler.  As detailed
in that chapter, your handler will first save the current value of IntR
(the return address to where you came from into this handler), and the
state of the interrupted program. Prior to doing the actual work for
handling the memory interrupt, the handler should enable interrupts
(which would have been disabled implicitly by the processor in the FETCH
 macrostate). The actual work to be done in the handler is to increment a
 error count variable in memory.  Once this work is done, the handler should
restore the state of the original program and return to where it came
from using RETI.
</p><p>
The handler you have written should run every time the memory interrupt
is triggered.  The handler should be written such that interrupts can be
 nested (i.e., higher priority interrupts should be allowed while
running the handler). With that in mind though, interrupts should be
enabled for as long as possible within the handler.
</p>
<p>Load the starting address of the handler into the memory error detection chip
 so that it will drive it to the bus when it recieves IntAck while waiting to 
interrupt.
</p>
<p>More information about this part of the project is included in prj2.s.  Search for the FIX ME to find where you need to modify code.  
</p>
<p>Once you have completed the interrupt handler you must assemble the entire program, and test it on your processor (this should be assumed).
