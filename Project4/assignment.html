<h1>CS 2200 Intro to Systems and Networks<br />
Project 4 - Virtual Memory<br />
Summer 2013 </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this project you will implement a virtual memory system. You will be given a
simulator that takes care of managing memory models, etc., but it has some parts
missing. The project will walk you through the implementation of each of these
parts step-by-step, asking questions about each step to make sure you understand
what you have to do before you go off and write code.
<br /><br />
The implementation itself is fairly straightforward. If you find yourself
struggling with the code, step back and think about what you are supposed to be
doing in theory. If you don't understand how the step should work, it will be
impossible to write it out in code.
<br /><br />
The assignment is organized into 6 steps, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Step 1 - Split the Address [10 pts total]</li>
  <li>Step 2 - Address Translation [20 pts total]</li>
  <li>Step 3 - Computing the EMAT [10 pts total]</li>
  <li>Step 4 - Handling Page Faults [20 pts total]</li>
  <li>Step 5 - Improving Page Replacement [20 pts total]</li>
  <li>Step 6 - Adding A TLB [20 pts total]</li>
</ul>
Each step starts with some theoretical questions. You <b>do not</b> have to
submit answers to these questions. They are there to guide you. If you can
answer the questions without much trouble, you will probably have an easy time
with this assignment. As was mentioned earlier, the code will be really hard to
write if you aren't comfortable with the concepts first. The questions are
designed to prepare you for the coding in each step, so do them first.
<br /><br />
Apart form the questions part, there will be a part to implement in code. This
will be described in the assignment, and will have FIXMEs (some with details if
required) in the appropriate file. Code that you have to complete for this 
assignment can be found in the files in the <code>student-src</code> directory,
while the simulator code can be found in <code>simulator-src</code>. You
probably shouldn't need to look at much (if any) of the simulator code aside
from the files we tell you to modify. At the end of this file we have included
an Appendix that discusses the simulator. It might be useful to read that if you
are having trouble figuring out how to do something.
<br /><br />

<h3>Compiling/Running</h3>
To recompile the simulator, we have provided a Makefile in the top level
directory. This can be used to build the project by simply typing <i>make</i>.
After you have built the program, you should find an executable named vm-sim
in the top level directory. To run this program, you <b>must</b> specify a
</i>references</i> file. A references file describes a series of memory
accesses.  The directory <code>references</code> contains four different
references files for your use:
<ul>
  <li><b>basic - </b>A basic references that yields no page faults <b>due to
  eviction.</b></li>
  <li><b>eviction - </b>A reference file that should produce a large number of
  page faults.</li>
  <li><b>tlb - </b>A reference file that should cause quite a few TLB hits.</li>
  <li><b>everything - </b>A reference file that produces a little bit of
  everything.</li>
</ul>
To run the simulator with a given references file, for example the
<code>basic</code> file, issue the following command:
<pre>
$ ./vm-sim references/basic
</pre>
There are several other command line options for the simulator that you can play
around with to adjust the memory size, page size and tlb size. You don't need to
use them, but you can play around with different settings to see the effect that
they have on the memory access time. The default settings, are a memory size of
16 values, a page size of 2 values, and a tlb size of 4.
<br /><br />
<h2>Step 1 - Split the Address [10 pts]</h2>
In modern virtual memory systems, the program written by the user accesses
memory using virtual addresses. The hardware and operating system work together
to translate these addresses into a physical address which can be used to access
physical memory. The first step of this process is to take the virtual address
and convert it into a physical address.
<br /><br />
Remember that a virtual address consists of two parts. The high-order bits make
up the <i>virtual page number</i> (VPN), and the low-order bits make up the
<i>offset</i>.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
On a certain machine, virtual addresses are made up of 16 bits. Each page on
this machine has 2^8 addressable locations. Answer the following questions:
<br />
<br />
<b>Question 1 - </b>How many bits must the offset be?
<br />
<b>Question 2 - </b>Recalling that the virtual address is split into the offset 
and VPN, how many bits is the VPN?
<br />
<b>Question 3 - </b>What is the VPN given the address 0xBEEF?
<br />
<b>Question 4 - </b>What is the offset given the address 0xBEEF?
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Look at file <code>page-splitting.h</code>. You should find two macros that are
used by the simulator to split the address. They are named VADDR_PAGENUM and
VADDR_OFFSET. They take a virtual address and return the page number or offset,
respectively. They currently do not function correctly. Fix them so they
properly return the virtual page number and offset.
<br />
<br />
[Hint 1: Use the global variable page_size to access the size of a page]
<br />
[Hint 2: While your first instinct is probably to do this using bitwise
arithmetic, it may make the implementation difficult. Think about using modulus
and integer division. It should be possible to implement each macro in
approximately one
 line of code with either method.]
<br /><br />
<h2>Step 2 - Address Translation [20 pts total]</h2>
Now that we can split the address, we are ready to translate the virtual address
into a physical address. This requires a page table to store the mapping between
virtual addresses and physical addresses. In the simulator, a page table is
represented as an array of the following structure:
<pre>
typedef struct {
   pfn_t pfn;           /* Physical frame number */
   unsigned char valid; /* Valid 'bit' */
   unsigned char dirty; /* Dirty 'bit' */
   unsigned char used;  /* Used (aka accessed recently) */
} pte_t;
</pre>
You'll notice, that the VPN doesn't appear as part of the page table. This is be
cause the page table is an array of these entries. The index into the array corr
esponds to the VPN. This allows the mapping from VPN to page table entry to be p
erformed very easily.
<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
Most of address translation deals with reading values from the page table. The
table below is similar in organization to the arrray of <code>pte_t</code>s
that is used in the simulator, although the size of the VPN and PFN have been
reduced to simplify the table. Assume that the page size is the same as that
used in the questions on address splitting. Assume that any VPNs that do not
appear in the table are <b>INVALID</b>.
<br /><br />
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr><th colspan=5> Page Table</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VPN</th>
    <th>PFN</th>
    <th>valid</th>
    <th>dirty</th>
    <th>used</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xDE </td>
    <td> 0xBE </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xF0 </td>
    <td> 0xD0 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xBE </td>
    <td> 0x42 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0x42 </td>
    <td> 0x43 </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> ...  </td>
    <td> ---- </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<b>Question 5 - </b>What physical address is 0xDEAD mapped to?
<br />
<b>Question 6 - </b>What physical address is 0xF00D mapped to?
<br />
<b>Question 7 - </b>Is the address 0x42ED valid?
<br />
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
After finishing the questions in the previous section, you should have a pretty
good idea about how the page table is used when translating addresses. Open up
the file <code>page-lookup.c</code>. In this file you will find a function
called <code>pagetable_lookup</code>. Modify this function to behave correctly.
Note that you will have to check to make sure the entry is valid. If it isn't,
you should increment the variable <code>count_pagefaults</code> and call the
function <code>pagefault_handler</code>.
<br />
When implementing address translation, keep in mind that the global variable
<code>current_pagetable</code> is a pointer to an array of page table entries
(<code>pte_t</code>), indexed by VPN.
<br /><br />
[Hint: You don't have to worry about marking the entry as dirty or used, or usin
g the TLB. This is already done for you by the simulator. You do, however, need 
to notify the page fault handler whether or not a write is required.]
[Note: In the questions, you were asked to find the physical <i>address</i>. In 
the function, you have to find the PFN. These are slightly different!]
<br /><br />
<h2>Step 3 - Computing the EMAT [10 pts total]</h2>
Now that we are getting some results from our simulator, we are ready to perform
some real computations with our results. The Estimated Memory Access Time, or
EMAT, is computed by figuring out the average amount of time for each access.
This gives us a measure of how much time each memory access takes on average.
Keep in mind that this is highly influenced by the memory access patterns of the
code you run.
<br />
<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
<b>Question 8 - </b>Assuming a memory access time of 100ns, and that an average disk access takes 10ms, how long would it take to access memory 10 times if 2 of those accesses resulted in page faults(which require disk access), and 4 of the accesses resulted in TLB misses?
[Hint: Don't forget to take into account the time it takes to access the page table.(2 accesses)]
<br />
<b>Question 9 - </b>While accounting for 2 memory access times for a tlb miss ,1  memory access for a tlb hit, and 2 memory accesses and a disk access for a page fault, what would be the generalized formula for the average time taken per memory access with only taking these constraints into effect?
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Obviously, computing EMAT by hand every time you run the simulator is quite
tedious.  Since it is generally better to make the computer do these kinds of
computations for us, this step of the project asks you to fix the function
<code>compute_emat</code> found in <code>emat.c</code>. This function takes no
parameters, but it has access to the global statistics maintained by in
statistics.h, specifically:
<ul class="ul1">
  <li><b>count_pagefaults</b> - The number of page faults that occurred.</li>
  <li><b>count_tlbhits</b> - The number of TLB hits that occurred.</li>
  <li><b>count_writes</b> - The number of stores/writes that occurred.</li>
  <li><b>count_reads</b> - The number of loads/reads that occurred.</li>
</ul>
Obviously, computing EMAT every time you run the simulator is quite tedious.
Since it is generally better to make the computer do these kinds of computations
for us, this step of the project asks you to fix the function compute_emat found
in <code>emat.c</code>. This function takes no parameters, but it has access to the global
statistics maintained by in compute_emat still works correctly.
<br /><br />
Your computation should use the constant values <code>DISK_ACCESS_TIME</code>
and <code>MEMORY_ACCESS_TIME</code> which are defined in <code>emat.c</code>.
For the purposes of this function, treat a TLB hit as taking no time when
looking up the VPN in the page table.
<br /><br />
<h2>Step 4 - Handling Page Faults [20 pts total]</h2>
What happens when the CPU encounters an invalid address in the page table? When 
this occurs, the OS should allocate a physical frame for the requested page, by 
either locating a free frame, or evicting a physical frame that is already in
use. After this occurs, the OS should update the page table to reflect the new
mapping, and then continue with the memory access.
<br /><br />
What exactly can cause this? Well, when a program is initially started, none of 
the virtual addresses are valid. When a given address is first used, the OS will
allocate a physical frame to store the information. If this keeps occurring, the
OS might be trying to allocate a new physical frame, when there is no memory
remaining. In this situation, the page fault handler will have to evict a
physical frame. When it does this, it moves the information stored there to the
hard disk, and then uses the recently cleared frame.
<br />
<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
<b>Question 10 - </b>If a page fault occurs, and there is an invalid frame in th
e physical memory, should you choose to evict a frame? When would this occur?
<br />
<b>Question 11 - </b>What is thrashing? How would a virtual memory system try to
 eliminate it?
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Look in the file <code>page-fault.c</code>, and you will find a partially
implemented page fault handler. Follow the comments detailed in the source file.
<br /><br />
While working on this, keep in mind that each process has a page table.
<code>current_pagetable</code> refers to the pagetable of the currently running
process (which is the one that needs a new page). The page table of the process
that owns the victim page can be found in the victim process control block
<code>victim_pcb</code>
<br /><br />

<h2>Step 5 - Improving Page Replacement [20 pts total]</h2>
Up to this point we haven't really worried about what happens when we have to
make more pages than we have room to store in physical memory. In reality, the
virtual memory system uses the hard drive to make it seem like there is
considerably more memory than there really is. While it is really slow to use
the hard drive in this manner, if page replacement is performed in an
intelligent manner it is much better than just stopping the user's program.
<br /><br />
Right now, the virtual memory system you have built uses a random page
replacement algorithm that we provided for you. As was discussed above, an
intelligent system would be much better than this. After asking some questions
about page replacement, we will ask you to implement one of the algorithms we
have discussed in class, and observe the impact that this can have upon EMAT.
<br /><br />
The optimal page replacement alogrithm would be to look into the future. Of all 
the physical frames, we should pick the one that is first used the longest time 
from now. We know that we will not have to evict a page again until that page is
accessed. Unfortunately, this algorithm requires me to be able to look into the
future, which isn't something that a modern computer is capable of doing.
Instead, we take advantage of temporal locality to justify the claim that if a
page was used recently, it is likely to be used again in the very near future.
While not optimal, the clock-sweep algorithm is a very reasonable algorithm,
because it is easy to implement and has relatively decent results in practical
use. For this project, you will be implementing the clock-sweep algorithm.
<br /><br />
The basic idea of clock-sweep is that you mark each page when it is used. When
you need to evict a page, you iterate (sweep) through memory examining each
frame's marked bit. If the page is marked, you unmark the bit. When you
encounter a page that isn't marked, that is the page you will evict. If you
reach the end of memory the search wraps around (this means that if all pages
are marked, we will unmark all the pages and then choose the page we started
with for eviction). Normally, clock-sweep remembers the page it left off on,
so that the next time it executes it continues on from there. For this
assignment you will <i>not</i> have to do that. If you do chose to do this,
however, you will earn brownie points.
<br /><br />
In Linux, the clock-sweep algorithm is sometimes also referred to as the second 
chance algorithm because it gives each page that has been marked as recently use
d a second chance at not-being evicted.
<br />

<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
Answer the following questions about page replacement, given the following page 
table. Assume that any entry not listed is <b>VALID</b> and <b>USED</b>.
<br /><br />

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr><th colspan=5> Page Table</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VPN</th>
    <th>PFN</th>
    <th>valid</th>
    <th>dirty</th>
    <th>used</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xDE </td>
    <td> 0xBE </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xF0 </td>
    <td> 0xD0 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xBE </td>
    <td> 0x42 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xBC </td>
    <td> 0x43 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0x42 </td>
    <td> 0xAB </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0x21 </td>
    <td> 0x23 </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> ...  </td>
    <td> ---- </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />

<b>Question 12 - </b>What is the first page that should be used when we need to 
allocate a new page?
<br />
<b>Question 13 - </b>Assuming that we are now using the page we selected in ques
tion 12 and no pages have been marked as used since then, what is the next page 
we will select?
<br />
<b>Question 14 - </b>Again, assuming that we are using the pages selected in que
stions 12 and 13 and no pages have been marked as used since then, which page is
 selected?
<br /><br />

<h3>Implementation</h3>
Now that you understand how page replacement is supposed to work, open up 
<code>page-replacement.c</code> and change the replacement algorithm to be more
intelligent.  You should do two things. If there is an invalid page, simply use
that one. If there are no invalid pages, perform a clock-sweep algorithm to
decide which page you should evict.
<br /><br />

<h2>Step 6 - Adding a TLB [20 pts total]</h2>
Accessing memory is slow. Virtual memory doesn't really help this, because page 
tables mean that we will have to access memory twice -- once to translate the
virtual address to the physical address, and again to actually access the
correct location. As useful as virtual memory is, if it caused every memory
access to take twice as long (or longer, if the hard drive came into play), it
would be an unacceptable cost for smaller programs that didn't need virtual
memory. Luckily, there are ways of reducing the performance hit.
<br /><br />
We obviously can't eliminate the actual memory access, but we can attack the
page table lookup by adding a small piece of hardware that keeps a small buffer
of past translations. If we can locate the virtual address in this buffer, we
can bypass the page table lookup. This buffer is called the Translation
Lookaside Buffer (TLB) because it provides an alternative means of performing
the lookup for translation.
<br />

<h3>Conceptual Questions</h3>
The structure of the TLB is remarkably similar to the page table. The biggest
difference is the fact that in the page table, the VPN serves as an index into
an array, but it is simply another entry in the TLB. This is because the TLB is
relatively small, and can't store every single entry. Use the TLB provided below
to answer the questions. The TLB is only capable of holding four entries. Assume
that any entry not explicitly present in the page table is <b>INVALID</b>.

<br /><br />
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr><th colspan=5> TLB </th></tr>
  <tr>
    <th>VPN</th>
    <th>PFN</th>
    <th>valid</th>
    <th>dirty</th>
    <th>used</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xDE </td>
    <td> 0xBE </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0xF0 </td>
    <td> 0xD0 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0x42 </td>
    <td> 0xAB </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> YES </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> 0x21 </td>
    <td> 0x23 </td>
    <td> YES </td>
    <td> NO </td>
    <td> NO </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br />
<b>Question 15 - </b>What address does the virtual address 0xDEAD translate to? 
Is this translation found in the TLB or the page table?
<br />
<b>Question 16 - </b>What address does the virtual address 0xBE21 translate to? 
Is this translation found in the TLB or the page table?
<br />
<b>Question 17 - </b>When we lookup the address 0xBC87, we miss the TLB. This
requires us to evict a an entry form the TLB. Which entry would we pick to
evict, assuming we use a standard clock-sweep algorithm?
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3>
Open up the file <code>tlb-lookup.c</code> and follow the comments describing
what needs to be fixed. You may want to note that you have access to the TLB
entries via <code>tlb</code> , which is an array of type <code>tlbe_t</code>
that contains <code>tlb_size</code> entries. Also keep in mind that since there
is <b>no relationship</b> between the index in the TLB and the content stored
there, you will have to check <b>every valid entry</b> in the TLB before
deciding that you were unable to find an entry. The structure of each entry is
shown below:
<pre>
typedef struct {
  vpn_t vpn;     /* Virtual page number */
  pfn_t pfn;     /* Physical frame number */
  uint8_t valid; /* Valid 'bit' */
  uint8_t dirty; /* Dirty 'bit' */
  uint8_t used;  /* Used (aka recently accessed) 'bit' */
} tlbe_t;
</pre>
<br />
<h2>Submission</h2>
When you are done with the project simply run <code>make</code> with the target
<code>submit</code> in the root directory of your project to produce a file
named <i>p3-submit.tar.gz</i> that contains everything you need to submit for
this assignment. Obviously, you will need to actually submit this file on
T-Square.
<br /><br />
<h2>Appendix A - The Simulator</h2>
This section is intended to serve as a reference to the simulator code, if you a
re interested in how the simulator works, or need to figure out how to do someth
ing.
<h2>Simulator Files</h2>
Simulator files are located in the directory <i>simulator-src</i>. You shouldn't
have to modify any of these. If you feel a need to look at any of the simulator
code, you should only need to look at the header files in there. To help you
understand how the simulator is organized, the following list explains what each
file in simulator-src does. For simplicity, we only list the filename, and not
the extension, as the header file serves the same purpose as the source file.
<ul>
  <li><b>global - </b>Provide a definition of 3 globally accessible values,
    specifically page_size, mem_size and tlb_size</li>
  <li><b>memory - </b>Provide a simulator for the physical memory of the
  computer.</li>
  <li><b>pagetable - </b>Provide an implementation of page tables. Of special
  interest to you should be the functions <code>pagetable_lookup</code>, which
  you have to write, and get_free_frame which will help you with the
  implementation of your page fault handler. The structure <code>pte_t</code>
  represents a single page table entry. If you need to get the page table of the
  currently executing process, the variable <code>current_pagetable</code> points
  to the appropriate array.</li>
  <li><b>process - </b>Provide an implementation of process control blocks, and 
  various methods for manipulating processes. You probably shouldn't be
  concerned with anything besides the process control block.</li>
  <li><b>sim.c - </b>This includes the main function for the simulator, and 
  primarily serves as an entry point to the rest of the code.</li>
  <li><b>statistics - </b>This file is used for the gathering and display of
  statistics.</li>
  <li><b>swapfile - </b>Provide a simulator for the disk, that allows us to move
   pages to the disk, and load pages from the disk.</li>
  <li><b>tlb - </b>Provide the representation of the TLB.</li>
  <li><b> types.h - </b>Provide some typedefs that allow us to refer to more
  descriptive types, such as <code>vpn_t</code> instead of <code>int</code>.
  </li>
  <li><b>useful.h - </b>Provide Some useful macros.</li>
</ul>
